Build a prototype of the orchestrator for the automation subsystem, which will receive messages from the scheduler (src/automation/scheduler), enqueue jobs for the worker (src/automation/cloud-worker), and receive results from the worker, all on service bus. The orchestrator will manage fan-out runbook execution, including step progression and rollback. Review the scheduler and cloud-worker components carefully. Make sure the orchestrator is fully compatible with the scheduler and prioritize tight integration with this component and coherent design. If changes are required to the cloud-worker to support integration with the new orchestrator (e.g., service bus message contracts), make those changes.
