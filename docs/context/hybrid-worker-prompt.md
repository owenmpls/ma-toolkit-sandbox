I need to add a new hybrid-worker component under src/automation, which should mirror the existing cloud-worker component as much as possible. The hybrid-worker will run on on-prem Windows servers or Windows VMs in other tenant/subscriptions. It does not need to connect to MgGraph or Exchange Online, and instead will use AD and Exchange Server management shells, meaning it needs to support PowerShell 5.1 processes. It also should support SharePoint Online and Teams PowerShell modules that still require PowerShell 5.1. This should be configurable, as not all worker instances will connect to all services. I need something that is easy to deploy and has a mechanism to update itself as new builds are pushed via CI/CD pipeline. It should use a service principal with cert auth to communicate with service bus, AKV, and whatever repository we use for new versions. It also needs to write log information to app insights or some other service in my subscription, similar to what the cloud-worker is doing. It should use the same jobs/results data contract as the cloud-worker.
